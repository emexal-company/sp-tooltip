# Spectrum Web Components

An open-source implementation of Spectrum, Adobe's design system, based on the HTML webcomponents standard. The webcomponents elements are developed using [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), and the CSS used is adapted from the official [Adobe Spectrum CSS](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css)
